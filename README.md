Phase 1: Data Collection and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Step 1 - Data Import and Preprocessing
Dataset 
 Load the dataset (Food_Delivery_Time_Prediction.csv).
Handle Missing Values
 Check for any missing or inconsistent values in columns such as Distance, Delivery_Time, etc. and decide how to handle them, either through imputation or deletion.


Data Transformation


Encode Categorical Variables: Use one-hot encoding or label encoding for variables like Weather Conditions, Traffic Conditions, Vehicle Type.
Normalize/Standardize Numeric Columns: Normalize or standardize continuous features like Distance, Delivery_sTime, and Order_Cost for consistency.
Step 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive Statistics
 Calculate the basic statistics for numerical features such as mean, median, mode, and variance.


Correlation Analysis
 Visualize correlations between features and the target variable (Delivery_Time) to identify the most relevant predictors.


Outlier Detection
 Detect outliers in numerical features using boxplots and handle them appropriately.


Step 3 - Feature Engineering
Distance Calculation
 If the dataset doesn't contain an actual distance metric, calculate the distance between the customer and restaurant using latitudes and longitudes (Haversine formula).


Time-Based Features
 Create new features related to the time of day, such as Rush Hour vs Non-Rush Hour, to improve predictions.

Phase 2: Predictive Modeling
Step 4 - Linear Regression Model
Train-Test Split
 Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split).


Model Building
 Use Linear Regression to predict the Delivery Time based on features like Distance, Traffic_Conditions, and Order_Priority.


Evaluation Metrics
 Evaluate the model using:


Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared (RÂ²)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Step 5 - Logistic Regression Model (for Categorization)
Model Objective
 Classify deliveries as "Fast" or "Delayed" based on binary features such as Traffic, Weather, Delivery_Person_Experience, etc.


Model Implementation
 Use Logistic Regression to predict the delivery status.


Evaluation Metrics
 Evaluate using metrics such as:


Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Confusion Matrix

Phase 3: Reporting and Insights
Step 6 - Model Evaluation and Comparison
Compare the Linear Regression and Logistic Regression models based on their performance (e.g., accuracy, confusion matrix).
Visualize the results using confusion matrices and ROC curves.
Step 7 - Actionable Insights
Based on model predictions, suggest operational improvements such as:
Optimizing delivery routes.
Adjusting staffing during high-traffic periods.
Providing better training to delivery staff
